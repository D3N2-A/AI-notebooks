    "   - Carefully analyze the problem provided by the user.\n",
    "   - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts if necessary.\n",
    "   - Formulate a clear understanding of the problem before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Thoughts:**\n",
    "   - Create multiple thoughts or steps toward solving the problem.\n",
    "   - For each thought, document your reasoning, ensuring that it is logical and well-founded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Self-Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - After generating each thought, evaluate its accuracy and quality.\n",
    "   - Assign an evaluation score between 0.1 and 1.0. Use the following guidelines:\n",
    "     - **0.1 to 0.4:** The thought is flawed, inaccurate, or incomplete.\n",
    "     - **0.5 to 0.7:** The thought is partially correct but may lack detail or full accuracy.\n",
    "     - **0.8 to 1.0:** The thought is accurate, complete, and well-reasoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Final Answer:**\n",
    "   - Based on your thoughts, synthesize a final answer to the problem.\n",
    "   - Ensure the final answer is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the overall quality and accuracy of your final answer.\n",
    "   - Provide a final evaluation score based on the same 0.1 to 1.0 scale.\n",

To recap, the reasoning relies on the behavior of binary representations and how power of 2 numbers are structured:\\n\\n1. **Binary Representation**: A power of 2 (like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) is represented in binary as having exactly one bit set to 1, followed by zeros. For example:\\n   - 1 in binary: `0001`\\n   - 2 in binary: `0010`\\n   - 4 in binary: `0100`\\n   - 8 in binary: `1000`\\n\\n2. **Subtracting 1**: When you subtract 1 from any power of 2, it flips all the bits after (and including) the lowest set bit:\\n   - For 4 (0100), subtracting 1 gives 3 (0011).\\n   - You can see that all bits after the least significant '1' bit have turned from 0 to 1.\\n\\n3. **AND Operation**: The bitwise AND operation between the original number `n` and `n - 1` will yield zero only if there was exactly one bit set in `n`. Therefore, `n & (n - 1)` is equal to 0 when `n` is a power of 2.\\n\\n4. **Condition**: In addition to checking the power of 2 condition, it's crucial to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 since the expression does not hold for zero or negative numbers.\\n\\nOverall, this method is computationally efficient and straightforward due to its constant-time complexity of O(1). It uses bitwise operations, which are generally faster than arithmetic operations or loops. Thus, this approach is highly effective and commonly used in programming to check for powers of 2.\",\n",

This can be checked using the expression `n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0`. The condition `n & (n - 1)` will be zero only if `n` is a power of two, as subtracting 1 from `n` flips all bits after the rightmost set bit, including it. This results in zero when performing the AND operation with `n`. Hence, the method is efficient and works in constant time O(1) without any loops or recursion, making it ideal for this functionality.

The key concept is to use the property that a number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. This can be checked using a bit manipulation technique:\\n\\n```python\\ndef is_power_of_two(n):\\n    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0\\n\\n# Test the function\\nprint(is_power_of_two(1))  # True (2^0)\\nprint(is_power_of_two(2))  # True (2^1)\\nprint(is_power_of_two(3))  # False\\nprint(is_power_of_two(4))  # True (2^2)\\nprint(is_power_of_two(8))  # True (2^3)\\nprint(is_power_of_two(10)) # False\\nprint(is_power_of_two(16)) # True (2^4)\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. `n > 0`: This checks that the number is positive since powers of 2 are always positive.\\n2. `(n & (n - 1)) == 0`: This checks that there is exactly one bit set in the binary representation of `n`. For example, for `n = 4` (which is 100 in binary), `n - 1` would be `3` (which is 011 in binary), and their bitwise AND would be `0`.\\n\\nThus, if both conditions are satisfied, `n` is a power of 2.\",\n",
