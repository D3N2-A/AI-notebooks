    "   - Create multiple thoughts or steps toward solving the problem.\n",
    "   - For each thought, document your reasoning, ensuring that it is logical and well-founded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Self-Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - After generating each thought, evaluate its accuracy and quality.\n",
    "   - Assign an evaluation score between 0.1 and 1.0. Use the following guidelines:\n",
    "     - **0.1 to 0.4:** The thought is flawed, inaccurate, or incomplete.\n",
    "     - **0.5 to 0.7:** The thought is partially correct but may lack detail or full accuracy.\n",
    "     - **0.8 to 1.0:** The thought is accurate, complete, and well-reasoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Final Answer:**\n",
    "   - Based on your thoughts, synthesize a final answer to the problem.\n",
    "   - Ensure the final answer is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the overall quality and accuracy of your final answer.\n",
    "   - Provide a final evaluation score based on the same 0.1 to 1.0 scale.\n",
